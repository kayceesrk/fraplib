"Formal Reasoning About Programs" code license information
<http://adam.chlipala.net/frap/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CAUTION: Most of the source files in this distribution are NOT
open-source in the usual sense.  See the comment at the beginning of
each source file for its license, which is Creative Commons, oriented
more toward free distribution of books than the usual collaborative
model of open-source software.  The author really is trying to keep
you from remixing your own versions of the book.

However, a few of the library modules used here are sufficiently
useful that they are released separately under a BSD license, included
below.  However, the author's advice is: please don't use these
library modules in real projects.  They are not designed for any use
beside getting the reader up and running quickly in reading the book,
sacrificing practicality (and minimal use of axioms) for simplicity.

The following license applies ONLY to the source files:
Relations.v
Map.v
Var.v
Invariant.v
ModelCheck.v
FrapWithoutSets.v
Sets.v
Frap.v
AbstractInterpret.v
SepCancel.v
